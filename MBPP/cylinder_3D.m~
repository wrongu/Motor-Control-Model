% Generate 3D points in a cylinder on the given axis at the given point,
% where the distance between adjacent points is less than the given
% resolution. The cylinder will span the length of axis perfectly

function [x y z] = cylinder_3D(axis, radius, start_point, resolution)
    vert_divisions = norm(axis)/resolution;
    circumference = 2*pi*radius;
    angle_divisions = circumference/resolution;
    
    % use built-in function to get unit cylinder with proper number of
    % divisions
    [x2 y2 z2] = cylinder(ones(vert_divisions,1), angle_divisions);
    
    % flatten point matrices to vectors
    x = reshape(x2, 1, numel(x2));
    y = reshape(y2, 1, numel(y2));
    z = reshape(z2, 1, numel(z2));
    
    % scale up
    x = x*radius;
    y = y*radius;
    z = z*norm(axis);
    
    % rotate
    axis = axis/norm(axis);
    rotation_axis = cross([0 0 1], axis);
    points = [x; y; z];
    points = rotationmat3D(
