% InverseKinematics(targetXYZ, currJointAngles, side, threshold)
%
% returns new joint angle configuration that puts the brainbot's gripper within
% 'threshold' of targetXYZ
%
% For this function to run quickly and effectively, targetXYZ should not be
% too far from the current position. In the generic sense, "too far" is
% based on the complexity (degrees of freedom) of the arm and the precision
% required. IE don't request a small threshold for a point far away.
%
% Inverse Kinematics implementation using Gradient Descent. The process is
% to compute a jacobian matrix for the change in position with respect to
% changes (plus epsilon) of joint configurations and call this a good
% approximation of the partial derivatives. The updated position is found
% using the Transpose of the jacobian (rather than its inverse), which is a
% good enough approximation. This algorithm iterates through this process
% using small spatial steps (Beta)
% 
% Copied from ForwardKinematics_V5:
% Rangles = [-angles(7), -angles(6), -angles(5), -angles(4), torsoangle, angles(1)];
% Langles = [angles(11), angles(10), angles(9), angles(8), torsoangle, angles(1)];
%
% TODO: add a tendency for servos to move towards 'ideal' positions as
% defined in get_servo_info.m
