% [center spanning_vectors] = get_goal_space_by_task(task, side)
%
% each task has a region of space that is defined to be 
%
% returns:
%   center              1x3 vector of center of goal space [x y z]
%   spanning_vectors    3x3 matrix of (row) vectors that span goal space. to
%                       generate a random goal point, take a linear
%                       combination of the vectors where the weights are in
%                       [-1, 1].
%
% EXAMPLE:
%   weights = rand(1,3)*2-1; % 3 random numbers on [-1, 1]
%   rand_goal = center + weights(1)*spanning_vectors(1,:) ...
%                      + weights(2)*spanning_vectors(2,:) ...
%                      + weights(3)*spanning_vectors(3,:);
%
% Note:
% - to weight to the outside of space, take the square root of the weight
% - to weight towards the center, square the weight
