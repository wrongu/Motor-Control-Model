% given a movement, this function will return an equivalent movement broken
% into smaller pieces such that no joint makes a step larger than the given
% threshold in one frame.
%
% each row of movement is a point in time, each column is a joint angle in
% radians

function new_movement = break_down_movement(movement, max_angle_step)
    % get the biggest step of any joint by using diff() along the time
    % dimension and finding the max
    [largest_step, index_ls] = max(diff(movement, 1, 1));
    
    [num_postures, num_angles] = size(movement);
    
    
    if(largest_step  > max_angle_step)
        num_new_divisions = ceil(largest_step / max_angle_step);
        new_movement = zeros(num_postures + num_new_divisions, num_angles);
        % movements in time up to the largest division are unchanged
        new_movement(1:index_ls,:) = movement(1:index_ls, :);
        % movement broken down smaller pieces where it
    else
        new_movement = movement;
        return;
    end
