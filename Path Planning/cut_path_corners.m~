% This function, given a path p, returns a new path (np) that cuts the
% corners of p where a line of sight is open.

function np = cut_path_corners(B, p)

    np = p;
    i = 1;
    
    % loop checking each segment. if clear to 2 ahead, remove point 1 ahead
    % as long as points are being removed, 
    while i < length(np)-2
        if(line_of_sight(B, np(i,:), np(i+2,:)))
            
        end
    end
